Reflection

In this activity, you used Tableau to link data together and visualize it. In the text box below, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of the following questions:

What did linking data from multiple sources allow you to do with your visualization in Tableau? 

What other kinds of datasets could you link to the four you used in this activity? What kinds of comparisons or insights could you make?

If you couldn’t link data in this way, how would you make complex comparative datasets and visualizations like this?




1. Linking data from multiple sources allowed me to create a unified visualization in Tableau that compares CO₂ emissions per capita by country over time, incorporating GDP, population, and energy use. This approach made it possible to see emissions trends and their relationship with economic and demographic factors.

2. In addition to the datasets used, linking datasets on renewable energy use, climate policies, or air quality would add more context to the analysis. For example, I could compare how countries' renewable energy adoption correlates with CO₂ emissions trends, offering insights into the impact of sustainable practices on emissions.

3. Without the ability to link data directly, I would need to manually combine datasets in a spreadsheet or database before importing them into Tableau. This approach is more time-consuming and prone to errors, making it harder to maintain or update the data for analysis.
